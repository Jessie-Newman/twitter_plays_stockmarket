# twitter_plays_stockmarket
Twitter users collaboratively try to make money on the stock market by telling a bot what to buy/sell. Money is fake but is based on live bid/ask. Uses tweepy and yfinance. 

This bot is pretty hacked together. I started it the day before Twitter announced they were killing their free API so had to launch it pretty quickly. I expect this bot will only live for a few days before losing API access.
